#	This next set of lines is to, as it appears, initialize the simulation
/run/initialize

#	Next are the LUXSim-specific commands

#	Set the output directory
/LUXSim/io/outputDir ./

#	Select the kind of detector to use
/LUXSim/detector/select 1_0Detector

#	Set the muon veto (a.k.a. the water shield) on or off
#/LUXSim/detector/muonVeto off

#	Set the cryostat stand on or off (not fully developed)
#/LUXSim/detector/cryoStand off

#   Set the level of grid wires:
# wires makes individual wires inside a grid frame (optical)
# plane places a thin sheet inside the grid frame rather than wires (background)
# off places nothing
/LUXSim/detector/gridWires off 

#	Update geometry
/LUXSim/detector/update


#	Select the record levels of the volumes. The default record level is 0.

#	These next commands demonstrate how you can set the record level of 
#	all components with the same base name in one command, but then set the
#	record level of individual components on a finer scale.
/LUXSim/detector/recordLevelOptPhot PMT_Window 1

#	Set the event generation.

#	This can be used in place of the regular the event generators. Be sure you
#	know what you're doing if you're going to use commands like these.
/gps/particle opticalphoton
/gps/energy 7 eV
/gps/pos/type Point 
/gps/pos/centre 0 0 0 mm
/gps/ang/type iso

#	Use this line instead of "/run/beamOn", as there is internal bookkeeping
#	that needs to occur before the run is started.
/LUXSim/beamOn 100
