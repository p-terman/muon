README for LUXSim

The documentation for LUXSim is on the LUX TWiki, available at

	http://teacher.pas.rochester.edu:8080/wiki/bin/view/Lux/LUXSim_SimulationDocumentation

Right now the documentation may be rather spare, but we hope to make this web
site the primary go-to place for everything related to the simulation.

The current version of GEANT4 used for the simulation is GEANT4.9.2. It may work
with other versions, but this is the supported version. If you want to use other
versions, support will be given as time and energy allows.

To compile LUXSim, type "make" from within the top-level LUXSim directory. It
should all work, either on Linux or MacOSX machines. If you have a Windows box,
support will be given as time and energy allows.

The plan is to have two readers available for the output data. One is in ROOT
format and the other is in Matlab format. For these readers to work, you should
of course have either ROOT or Matlab installed on your computer.
